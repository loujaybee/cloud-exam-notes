# Intro To Cloud On AWS

## Availability Zones, Regions, Edge

* A region is a collection of AZ's
* An AZ is within a region
* Some regions have ~3 AZ's, some have more
* Edge locations

// TODO: 👷‍♀ How many AZ's does each region have?
// TODO: 👷‍♀ Is an edge within an AZ or just a region?

## 3 Reasons For Choosing a Region

1. Latency to the user — You need to be located closer to the user.
1. Data laws — You have legal requirements that means you need to be in a given region.

// TODO: 👷‍♀ What's the third reason!?
